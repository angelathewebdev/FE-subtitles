who wants to be awesome at their jobs?
raise your hand, okay
so those of you not raising your hand
I'm gonna assume you're already awesome
so let me ask you a different question
who wants to be happy at work? right
now everyone should be raising their hand
why won't you want to be happy?

so think about the last time you were really happy at work
what were you doing?
what I want you to do is I want you to hold that moment in your mind
while we talk about
(the clickers are not working)
I want you to hold that moment in your mind
(there we go)
while we talk about what it takes to be happy

for some people, it might just be stability and paycheck
but while getting paid is certainly nice
I believe you have a desire
a desire for a job that is gonna challenge you
and engage you and give you an opportunity for growth

so there have been a lot of studies on happiness
and one of more prominent ones was wrote by professor chickson mih
who also coined the term flow and in his study
he said the best moments were not the ones where we are sitting passive
and just kind of waiting and receptive and relaxing
but the best moments are actually when we push ourselves
and we put in a lot of efforts achieve something worthwhile
and this is actually a really beautiful thing
because this means we can control and we can make ourselves happy

when he talks about with flow
and I'm sure many of you have heard this term
it's that moment when your work feels effortless
when you finish you have this great sense of accomplishment and achievement
so flow is most likely to occur when you have the challenge of your work maps to your skills for that task
achieve flow in a lot of ways is like mastery

the thing about flow and mastering things is that 
in order to stay in that state
you've got to seek out new challenges and information
as if it's an ongoing journey
flow isn't a destination that you arrive at
it's a process

and suddenly the question becomes how do we flow
and this is where magic and abstraction come into our story
you see mastery is achieved through understanding
and understanding means we aren't going to accept the magic and the tools and the technology and dive down into the abstractions that are supporting our work
so what do I mean by this illusion of abstraction and magic

well if you think about it
programming and of itself is an act of creating abstraction
you're building a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts
a more concrete example
if you have a buck of logic gates
and you put them together
and you can build a circuit
if you put a bunch of circuits together
you can build a computer
if you put a bunch of 0s and 1s
you can put a programming language
and build a file system
and build an application
and eventually a website that shows pictures of funny cats

and in each level
there is an abstraction
and these abstractions kind of transcend
all the parts that put them together

but the thing is, if you want to be a master
you can't accept abstractions
if fact I believe you can't do anything magical of your own
unless you understand the illusion supporting your tools

so let me tell you a little story to illustrate this point
in the late 1600s, there is a promising alchemist named johan beker
he worked tirelessly to help determine the formula to turn metal into gold
he felt like he was so close in the progress
he was so blinded by his ambitions
that he decided to do a little demo for his friends
almost an illusion magic trick if you will
where he performs this transformation
and while his demo went off without a hitch
he didn't account for the king would catch a wind of this experiment
and before long he was in prison forced to reproduce his results

so after years of trying without success
since it involves nuclear power which he didn't have
he was about to be put to death
but the king gave him one more chance
because your see in his time
porcelain was valued equal to gold or silver
but no one had quite figured out the mystery to manufacture it yet
so he focused on really understanding the abstraction
which is material, method, and equipment
and everything you would need to create porcelain
it was through this careful experimentation
this alchemist turned industrial chemist
was able to produce the first European porcelain

and it is through understanding and mastery
he was able to create real magic
this theme of deep understanding and mastery
carry through time to our profession too
important achievements like the SPDY protocol wouldn't have been possible without really understanding low level networking and browser internals
similarly the Sencha team created their own version of the Facebook IOS app which they dubbed Fastbook to show that
if you took the time to understand what was going on under the hood you can build a great app in HTML5

in my own experience we launched a rail app
that buckled under the weight of our users
because we didn't fully understand everything active record
was doing under the covers
and it was only through careful analysis
that seemingly innoculous query generated this view
and all of these other views
that we are able to understand what we need to do to scale our systems
to meet our customer demands

but this is the thing
as you get more and more magic and abstraction in your tools
it becomes more and more important to look inside that black box
and understand what is happening
at a minimum you need to understand where your abstraction falls apart
I consider this having a car mechanism level of ability for all the tools you use
this means you've taken the time to understand how to deploy and install all the software
that you know the performance and reliability characteristics of your stack
that you know who to call and where to look when things don't work the way you think they should

getting back to our original point about being happy
since that's what you care about
so being happy is about finding flow
all of this flows from mastery
if you want to be successful in an area of your life
it really comes down to mastering the laws of cause and effect

if you know someone who is an amazing developer
then chances are they have mastered the cause
which is the effort required to achieve the effect
which is their desire result or outcome

because success isn't chance
success is mastering

if you want to be successful
I'm pretty sure you all do
the driving desire to be a master is critical in that journey
and in technology
mastering can only be achieved through understanding
but this understanding implies you are going to stop accepting magic
and push through those plateaus and dips and learning curves

this means that you're going to look at every new tasks that comes to you
with what is the most I can do here
or how can I blow people away with this project
and when you do this
this process is not just a destination
it is a whole journey and it is an exciting one

there is simply no way to be perfect at what you do
but there are perfect moments
the brilliant slivers of time where everything just comes together and falls into place
and it's these moments that make everything worthwhile

this is good because at the end of the day
mastering requires sacrifice
this path is like a common one or an average attempt that you can do in your regular working hours or in your spare time
it means if you truly want to be be a master
you're actively spending time there and forego other pursuits
because we are defined by what we make time to do
not by what we do when we have time

I'm gonna leave you with one final thought
in the end, this pursuit can lead to success in a job you love
but most of all I want you to have a good reason
to start accepting magic and go and create magic of your own

thank you
