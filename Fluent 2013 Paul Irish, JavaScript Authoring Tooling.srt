1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:06,939
alright last year I was actually
on this stage and uh...
去年我来这里讲过, 等下我直接播放好叻

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,130
and I gave a little talk actually
I'm just gonna play quick uh...
excerpts of of that right
去年我来这里讲过, 等下我直接播放好叻

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:16,298
now

4
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:17,390
I talked about
我讲的下一个话题是关于

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:19,118
web development workflow
Web开发工作流程

6
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,448
because I think over the past two
years in particular there's been a
lot of tools that
我认为这两年有很多新的工具

7
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:26,609
we've got in as developers to increase
our productivity, reduce our stress
可以加快开发者的工作流程

8
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,219
putting them together in kind of a
work flow that make sense has been
an interesting challenge
如何把他们融合在一起是一个有趣的挑战

9
00:00:30,219 --> 00:00:33,460
so I'm gonna walk through what
my approaches has been and some of
the approaches I've seen other
所以我来谈谈我还有其他人是如何做的

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,960
developers doing

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,800
uh... first thing i should point out
先说一下

12
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:40,659
please try and pay no attention to the
enormous rhinoceros genetalia behind
(这句话我不翻译啦)

13
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,919
me

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,070
it is distracting
大家不要为了它而分心哟

15
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,289
it is very distracting

16
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:49,880
um...

17
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:54,480
but anyway so yes last year i talked
about the javascript workflow of 
不管怎样, 去年我谈了2013 JS开发工作流程

18
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,489
2013

19
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,240
um... so i've figured it would be kind
of good to revisit that now that it's
我觉得应该回顾一下, 毕竟现在就是2013

20
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,329
2013 so this is the javascript
authoring workflow of now

21
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:07,269
um...yeah

22
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:11,859
a few things I touched on last year
uh... just quick little excerpts
再上一段视频嘞

23
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,239
things here and there
(开播了)

24
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,420
so I think having realtime feedback
我认为有实时的反馈很重要

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,340
is an important thing live recompilation
and live reload now massages ?
比如实时更新, 还有实时编译等

26
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,280
here

27
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,820
the sass final
你看这里, 编译后的Sass

28
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,549
the next is source maps
然后我们谈谈source maps

29
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:25,890
okay just
(okay, 大家回神了)

30
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,849
quick little

31
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:31,829
bits and bobs of technologies um... buzz
words but all useful things
去年演讲中提到的这几个流行词

32
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:34,549
and last year I kind of showed kind of putting
these together kind of disparate
有大概谈谈他们是怎么结合在一起

33
00:01:34,549 --> 00:01:36,599
technologies to kind of come into

34
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,688
a workflow that kind of works together
uh... but on the chrome dev tools team we've been
之后我们Chrome 开发者工具团队就一直在想如何

35
00:01:40,688 --> 00:01:44,709
thinking about this and figured out how we can
make this into a more cohesive workflow
把他们更好的融入到开发者工具里面

36
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:48,209
and I wanna show you some of the
features uh...
今天就来展示一下成果

37
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,869
that have come out of that work
the first up is called workspaces
第一个是Workspaces

38
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,719
um... but um...
噢噢

39
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:00,700
uh... this is embarrassing uh... so
just bear with me I'm gonna fix this now
等下个...让我修修

40
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,189
just dadan da
(哼歌中...)

41
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:07,700
just kill this actually I'm gonna
come to my editor
让我把这个干掉, 然后去我的编辑器

42
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,438
let's make some
把新的样式放在这里

43
00:02:08,438 --> 00:02:13,338
room for that so that we can put in some
new styles uh... I don't need this width
哒哒哒...不需要这个width

44
00:02:13,338 --> 00:02:17,229
that should fix that I can turn off this box shadow
然后关掉这个box-shadow

45
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:22,488
Get a line height, that looks about right-ish
加个line-height, 这样就差不多了

46
00:02:22,489 --> 00:02:23,959
and font size
再来个font-size

47
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:25,769
uh...

48
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,968
alright, let's bring these changes over to my editor
酱紫, 来到我的编辑器

49
00:02:30,968 --> 00:02:32,289
change on disk reload
所有改动立刻浮现哈

50
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:35,728
sure sure, oh

51
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:37,650
oh, all right

52
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:44,650
as you can see here

53
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:49,079
nice dev tools is doing this work for
me so i'm making changes in the styles 

54
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,368
panel

55
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:54,308
it's going to bring these back to disk
so let's say I actually wanna add something back over

56
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,838
here inside sublime and let's see
we'll do 1px 1px 10px and

57
00:02:57,838 --> 00:02:59,258
white

58
00:02:59,258 --> 00:03:03,608
um... just hit save and come over

59
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:05,120
here, yeah, that's that's

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,079
looks pretty pretty good, but
I'm gonna go with black instead

61
00:03:09,079 --> 00:03:11,209
yes that's sharp okay cool

62
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:15,150
styles are looking good but we still have

63
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,989
Whoops

64
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:17,558
um...

65
00:03:17,558 --> 00:03:22,539
so this is a HTML slide deck but
I'm using markdown for the contents

66
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,698
so let's

67
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:26,049
edit the markdown I'm gonna hit the Command + O

68
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:28,859
and it bring up slides.md

69
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:30,729
and uh... here

70
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:35,409
is that typo just change that to
lowercase and hit Command + S to save

71
00:03:35,408 --> 00:03:37,388
and refresh

72
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,789
looking good... cool nice

73
00:03:39,788 --> 00:03:42,129
so this is workspaces

74
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:47,938
workspaces allows me to bring in
folders on my system into the dev tools

75
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:50,459
and edit it what the dev tool is going to do is

76
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,489
map this to what's coming over the wire
so i can i make full backend and serving up

77
00:03:54,489 --> 00:03:55,460
this content

78
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,180
dev tools going map the resources so 
that when i make changes to things on

79
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,969
screen it's gonna be able to make these
changes to what's persistent on disk as well

80
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:05,968
I can edit everything this is you know

81
00:04:05,968 --> 00:04:09,318
this is mark down here the dev tool team
itself actually edit the c++ bindings for
dev tool inside of dev tools

82
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:12,149

83
00:04:12,149 --> 00:04:13,140
um...

84
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:16,889
style changes as they make them over
here in the styles panel they persist all these

85
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,859
changes are kept on persistent disk
I can edit anywhere

86
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,878
full undo redo, especially here

87
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:24,919
uh... man this is great because I'm able
to maintain my context and not keep

88
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:28,990
switching between two separate things
just do it all in one place

89
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,610
uh...

90
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,740
all right, next thing up

91
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,879
sass this was something that i
mentioned last year and a lot of people

92
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:39,339
have been asking about this I want to
bring you up-to-date with how this works

93
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:41,338
inside of dev tools now

94
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:43,009
alright to do this I would bring up

95
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:46,490
uh... version of HTML5 please

96
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,509
and this is looking good

97
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:52,649
but I wanna actually try experimenting
with this guy right here this little use

98
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,378
badge

99
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:59,028
so uh... open up the dev tools you know what
I'm gonna try to change the color of it

100
00:04:59,028 --> 00:05:01,230
all right so here we are

101
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:03,050
that's good

102
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,610
the uh... uses got a background box-shadow
and border-right

103
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,528
green and getting a little getting darker in
the greens as it goes down

104
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:17,050
so if we want to try to change the color
I'm really keen on indigo lately

105
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,400
uh... I don't know why, it's cool

106
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:24,500
but that really don't work out well so hot

107
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,668
hmm...Command + Z

108
00:05:25,668 --> 00:05:27,930
good yes uh...

109
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,889
so if i click through the actual style on CSS

110
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:36,629
those of you are SASSies will notice this
looks like compiled uncompressed

111
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,629
CSS coming from the styles panel compiler

112
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,309
so what i should really be doing is authoring in SASS

113
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,759
so let's turn that on

114
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:50,160
we go the dev tool setting and bring up
experiments and turn on Sass, cool

115
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,529
refresh the page

116
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:53,168
bring back up the dev tools

117
00:05:53,168 --> 00:05:55,418
and go back to my selection

118
00:05:55,418 --> 00:05:58,978
now the first thing that you're gonna
notice is pretty small

119
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,240
is that here against the usual you're
seeing the location in the sass file

120
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,619
where this is coming from

121
00:06:04,619 --> 00:06:07,240
so Imma click through on that

122
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,348
all right cool so here we are in my sass file

123
00:06:10,348 --> 00:06:15,300
and uh... looks like use is actually using a mixin

124
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,270
uh... but i wanted to change that color
so we're gonna have to dig a little bit deeper

125
00:06:20,269 --> 00:06:22,538
so i come back over here and I hit Command

126
00:06:22,538 --> 00:06:25,899
and you can now see that these things
are a little clickable so I'm gonna

127
00:06:25,899 --> 00:06:27,500
Command + click on background

128
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,988
and we jump into the extends file where
our mixins are defined

129
00:06:31,988 --> 00:06:34,369
background box-shadow border-right and yeap

130
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:36,718
the color that's coming in

131
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:40,339
right here is in fact is being
darkened as it comes down

132
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:41,938
all right that makes sense

133
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,210
but again I need to change that color
and I come back to elements and command click 

134
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:47,028
on the color itself

135
00:06:47,028 --> 00:06:48,158
all right

136
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,319
so now we are over here in our

137
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,759
in our _vars.scss file

138
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,559
and the cursor is placed immediately
where this variable was defined

139
00:06:55,559 --> 00:07:00,199
so the use one is right here and
this is that green and um...

140
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,319
uh... so i want to try it as being

141
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,460
indigo, Command + S

142
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:13,459
yeah...nice

143
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:20,149
it's pretty good but honestly that green
color worked the best

144
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:24,149
so just command + Z to back my way to that green

145
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:27,968
cool, all right so this is done with no chrome
extensions at all so this is just straight up dev tools

146
00:07:27,968 --> 00:07:29,019
in fact

147
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:33,778
the only thing that I have going on in
addition to uh... the Sass support and

148
00:07:33,778 --> 00:07:34,899
workspaces

149
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:36,348
is I do have

150
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:40,738
a Sass watch daemon just watching
these things and recompile in

151
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:42,288
on-the-fly

152
00:07:42,288 --> 00:07:46,688
but dev tools is doing the work of
bringing in the new changes as they come in

153
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:50,129
so we have full traceability from my css
the selectors, properties, and

154
00:07:50,129 --> 00:07:53,919
variables back to the original sass
sources whether came from a mixin or a

155
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:55,478
variable or whatever

156
00:07:55,478 --> 00:07:58,808
this is actually enabled by
source maps I talked about it last year

157
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:02,879
source maps are javascript this is the same
technology just for css

158
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,660
uh... and this was contributed

159
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,420
uh... to the sass compiler core by the
dev tools team and I should mention that

160
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,580
um... if you're not sass user and you
like stylus or less

161
00:08:11,579 --> 00:08:17,248
uh... the limitations completely agnostic so
once less or stylus gets support to

162
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:19,110
create the source maps

163
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,088
it's gonna work the exact same way

164
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:23,699
and a full automatic reload of the stylesheet

165
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:25,639
as changes coming

166
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,699
pretty nice

167
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:31,679
so these changes combined really change things
up dev tool can become my editor

168
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:35,389
uh... i think it's really powerful 
cuz I'm getting this real time feedback as i'm

169
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,129
typing as I'm making changes

170
00:08:37,129 --> 00:08:40,370
I see the style changes as I type them
out whether in css or

171
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,310
sass

172
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,750
is persistent to disk

173
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,799
by way of uh... workspaces

174
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,339
if I'm doing javascript I can edit that and
it's re-evaluated on-the-fly it's

175
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,080
patched up to send to V8 and it
just takes care of it great when you're

176
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,830
doing any sort of campus work ?

177
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:57,090
uh...

178
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,160
in this also cool because when
you author code and you seem to debug ?

179
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:04,568
environment you can place break point right
about the same place which leads to a great

180
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:07,579
cohesive environment, all right

181
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,980
last year I also brought a package
management but I covered it in kind of

182
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,930
hint wavy way I'm gonna play that

183
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,089
package management is

184
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:20,660
something that in a year from now
we're gonna have really robust package

185
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:24,969
management tooling infrastructure and a
lot of packages in the community right

186
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:29,509
now it's kind of still finding its
foothold but we will be seeing some more

187
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:32,350
things coming up soon I think

188
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:37,350
yeah uh... was actually just a few weeks
before the release of bower

189
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,778
bower is a package manager project that
I have been involved in since the beginning

190
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:43,619
and it's really been taken off fantastic
thing uh... the community in the

191
00:09:43,619 --> 00:09:47,168
registry have kind of blown up this is a
view of all the components

192
00:09:47,168 --> 00:09:51,199
that are in bower and it's now up to a
little over twenty-two hundred

193
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,759
components available in the registry

194
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,370
really great for you as a user and
whenever you want to pull something

195
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,470
and it has dependencies it works great

196
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,629
also great for the ecosystem because it
means that we're able to build upon each

197
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:06,240
other's work in a lot more of a cohesive way

198
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,570
if you want to get up to speed on this
there was a great presentation about

199
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,650
bower down in google IO just two weeks ago
dan hoverd showed off a lot of great

200
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:17,289
stuff including a really nice workflow
using bower and requirejs also yeoman

201
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:18,230
and grunt

202
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,570
to create this great experience of using
package management something that you

203
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,479
might expect from another language

204
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:28,350
uh... but having it here inside of
uh... javascript for the front end

205
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,220
alright wanna come back to performance
and talking about performance at a 

206
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,199
javascript conference

207
00:10:33,198 --> 00:10:36,149
uh... i might talk about javascript
performance

208
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:36,700
but it's

209
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,990
good to keep in mind that

210
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:40,470
javascript is not

211
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,519
kind of

212
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,480
it's not always the best target

213
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,800
these are slides from actually from the
IE team back when they're released

214
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:49,469
IE8

215
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,620
but this stuff is as true it was then as it is now

216
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:56,830
up here we have they took a look at the top one hundred sites and saw where

217
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,930
IE was spending its time

218
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:00,958
and just sixteen percent of its time was spent

219
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:02,149
in javascript

220
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:06,169
rest of it in layout rendering formatting
and here for ajax heavy sites like

221
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:10,349
javascript heavy sites like uh... gmail
google maps

222
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,350
uh... just still a fraction

223
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,759
so javascript is often a small
fraction of the overall performance

224
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,700
picture

225
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,819
so if you want to find out how to make

226
00:11:19,818 --> 00:11:22,039
your app your site fast

227
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,409
I recommend you take a look at the timeline
inside the chrome dev tools so

228
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:28,309
uh... I'm gonna show that to you now

229
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:29,239
all right

230
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,340
so this is a kind of info graphic parallax site

231
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,480
it's pretty cool

232
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,149
and I'm just gonna scroll through it so
you get a chance to see what's going on so as I

233
00:11:38,149 --> 00:11:43,319
scroll down I got this orange
circle bubbly guy and these

234
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,940
circles over here where is comes to

235
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,660
some awesome physics explosion

236
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:48,799
uh...

237
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:53,229
and then come down here we have a parallax
effect it's pretty cool I keep going down

238
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,649
and uh...keep going down

239
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,870
these white little dots form these gride
and just take over the place

240
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,039
and that's about it, all right

241
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,039
let's come back up and open up dev tool this time

242
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:07,589
and drag it down to the bottom

243
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,990
open up the timeline

244
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,100
and i'm gonna start recording

245
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,329
just hit Command + D

246
00:12:13,328 --> 00:12:15,139
It's kind of quick

247
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:19,809
and then I'm just gonna scroll through
the same stuff

248
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:24,679
dudu dudu

249
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,029
all right, what's really cool about that
is we get for you the

250
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:30,129
performance of the this page kind of in a 

251
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:31,269
narrative

252
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:33,549
it starts off at the beginning it's pretty chill

253
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:36,649
and then we move on to the sections here
where there's a lot of green

254
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:38,058
now this is up at the top

255
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,610
where we are building out this kind of orange

256
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:45,039
explosion of circles and the green is time spent in paint

257
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,588
and here we are painting the entire
page on every single frame

258
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,430
it's taking a good amount of time

259
00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:53,120
then going into this section where there's a lot of yellow

260
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,039
and this is javascript executing

261
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,730
that is when we're hitting

262
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:58,940
uh... this little physics action right here

263
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,170
that it's pretty quiet for the section
in the middle we are hitting our target

264
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:06,250
frame budget of sixty FPS mostly frames stay underneath that

265
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,539
for the most part

266
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:10,669
and then down at the bottom we kind of have
this cacophony of colors

267
00:13:10,669 --> 00:13:13,919
a lot of things happening as this kind of
white things exploding

268
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,860
uh... both painting javascript and also
a good amount of a purple layout here

269
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,120
uh... is going on

270
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,659
but timeline is giving us this overall
view of finding where our bomb are ?

271
00:13:24,659 --> 00:13:27,860
of each section so we can deal with a bit
more precise in how we adjust these

272
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,110
performance issues

273
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,810
so if I wanna look into

274
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:36,319
this section right here I'm gonna do that
so let's see right here

275
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,300
uh... and I want to get a better idea of
this javascript performance

276
00:13:41,299 --> 00:13:43,490
so let's do that

277
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,919
I'm gonna go over to profiles and collect a CPU profile

278
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:51,789
Hit Command + E

279
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,709
and

280
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:54,970
it's probably good

281
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,470
and now if I come over here and uh...

282
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,480
so this you should be used to

283
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,450
kind of the aggregate view of everything that's going on

284
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:08,320
and it is telling me kind of here are
all the things that happened information

285
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,010
well what it's not doing it is

286
00:14:10,009 --> 00:14:13,559
giving it to me and kind of this view
I could see frame by frame

287
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,959
what happened bit by a bit

288
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,110
so this is we found we can
address and also give you a better idea as

289
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,919
far as

290
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:22,748
of visualization of this action

291
00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:25,279
so I want to show it to you a new feature

292
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,019
and it's called the flame chart

293
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:29,990
uh...all right

294
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:32,279
so here we have the flame chart

295
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:36,759
we're able to identify kind of at
time scale across time how things are

296
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,629
changing in this case it's actually pretty consistent

297
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,189
um... frame by frame looks like it's
mostly executing the same javascript

298
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,820
it would change color if not

299
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,290
uh... and then it also 

300
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:49,709
drill in so this is one frame in particular

301
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,790
and

302
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:53,009
in this case uh...

303
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:53,889
width is time

304
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:57,179
and height is call stacks so height's not too important

305
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:58,339
but umm

306
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:02,460
if I wanna look in I can see a few things let's say

307
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,030
uh... here

308
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:07,429
looks like D3 is kind of running
the show all my time to spend inside D3

309
00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:08,419

310
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:12,779
we got some insert child so it's doing some SVG inserting

311
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:19,240
uh... and then we have this quadtree view 
quadtree view quadtree view quadtree view
insert child

312
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,110
but also inserting attribute function just
settings new attributes in the SVG at the

313
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,600
end of the frame

314
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,960
this is a seven milliseconds in this case
which is a considerable amount of time

315
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,720
to happen every single frame

316
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,600
but this visualization is giving me a great view as far as what is soaking up this

317
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,790
time and what should i address first

318
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:39,659
so that's the new flamed chart

319
00:15:39,659 --> 00:15:41,699
you can check it out in chrome canary today

320
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,090
uh... we also have a canvas profiling
experiment that I want to show to you now

321
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:51,850
so this here just this webGL aquarium
and Imma open up the dev tools

322
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:56,779
and take a canvas profile so it's
gonna record single canvas frame and

323
00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:00,500
it's recording all the calls that
contributed to that frame

324
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:04,129
and poke through all the draw calls
one-by-one and just hitting the down arrow

325
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:06,090
on the keyboard walking through

326
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,360
how the scene was actually drawn so you can see

327
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,820
the fishes come in and the shark come in

328
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,670
the the the ball kind of come in
and everything else

329
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:18,639
and then you open up the draw calls
and see all the function calls

330
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,259
that contributed to that draw

331
00:16:20,259 --> 00:16:21,950
and go back to the sources

332
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,210
so this is cool but this is a platform
this is we are able to record and replay

333
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,120
canvas and webGL action

334
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,568
uh... but really where we go from here

335
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:34,358
is up to you and so please wrench in
your feedback in kind of what you would

336
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:38,889
like to see next as far as a canvas profiler

337
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:42,649
all right I'm gonna wrap-up with five key
dev tools performance features

338
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:44,970
first up continuous repaint mode

339
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,009
if you're in the timeline you see a lot
of time spent inside green painting

340
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,850
then you probably wanna head over t
continuous repaint mode what it's gonna do

341
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,999
is tell the browser

342
00:16:52,999 --> 00:16:55,759
hey paint the page again and again and again

343
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,730
and what this allows you to do is turn off elements and styles

344
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:01,789
and figure out what is contributing to the
amount of time that it takes to paint

345
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:02,769
the page

346
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:06,709
uh... and this is able to uh... to let
you find out what's contributing what you

347
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:11,230
could adjust uh... it the changes so
it's a it's a little tough to

348
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,470
given aggregate view of

349
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,329
but you're able to find out exactly
what's contributing there

350
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:19,269
and also the FPS Meter um... which
gives you a good view of how fast you're

351
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:21,029
sending updates to the screen

352
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:24,930
so in addition to showing the frames per second
we also have min and max in that view

353
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,110
and a histogram

354
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,298
also the GPU memory so you can see how much memory

355
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,388
is being used by the current tab, how
much is allocated if you have a lot of

356
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:36,308
heavy imagery you're going to constantly
evicting things out of the GPU

357
00:17:36,308 --> 00:17:40,930
memory which is probably gonna soak up a good amount of GPU performance

358
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:45,140
uh... next up show paint rects and layer borders
these are available as settings inside

359
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,969
dev tools

360
00:17:45,969 --> 00:17:49,940
really great at identifying paint 
issues so you might be repainting

361
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,750
the entire page on every single scroll

362
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,779
you don't wannna to do that and this is
going to show you a visual view of that

363
00:17:55,779 --> 00:17:58,979
happening really fast in this case uh...
it looks like

364
00:17:58,979 --> 00:18:01,058
this div was just repainted and we have

365
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:04,569
uh... a layer over here with the gold border

366
00:18:04,569 --> 00:18:08,500
it's actually the scrollbar which
chrome actually composites right on

367
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,210
top of the page

368
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:14,890
the object allocation trackers a brand
new tool if you're doing a lot of memory

369
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:18,440
analysis this is going to key for you so
you hit a do recording and it's gonna take

370
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:24,490
continual heap snapshots over time
that's how it identifies drillin on one specific part

371
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,240
to see what objects were allocated in that section

372
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,250
and what they retain size and what they
retaining tree which is great even try

373
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,240
to identify where your memory is coming
from and where it's going

374
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,190
lastly layout thrashing back in uh...
this timeline here

375
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:43,470
we see a good amount of time spent in
layout

376
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:47,519
and here we're able to identify a
bunch of stuff have you had a DOM heavy

377
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:49,210
web applications

378
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,170
you might see something like this where
you doing layout and layout and layout

379
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,410
and there's no paint you do it all this
work and you're asking browser to do all this

380
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,220
work

381
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:02,100
and the users never seen a lot of it and
this is a problem dev tools is gonna

382
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,000
tell you that with this little icon that there is
possible performance bottleneck

383
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,730
uh... this is also gonna give you
a lot of other useful information too

384
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:13,500
the amount of nodes that need layouts
the tree size the scope

385
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,150
and also a full call stack for why the
layout was invalidated why it was forced to

386
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:22,030
conjoint as functions and find exactly
why things were caused maybe you're gonna need

387
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,119
to change some things around

388
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:27,639
so a lot of details and this is key to getting good performance on web

389
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,299
applications

390
00:19:29,298 --> 00:19:33,420
okay that's a lot of stuff the chrome tools documentation 
has recently got a bunch of

391
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:37,070
new updates covering these things
and a bunch more including remote

392
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:41,829
debugging everything i show today uh...
is available as you remote debug your

393
00:19:41,829 --> 00:19:46,308
phone uh... so it's a really powerful
setup and I encourage you to check that out

394
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:50,259
uh... everything I should today is also
available in canary some of them behind

395
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:54,220
experiments but I encourage you to check out
try things holler at me and tell me what

396
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,860
you like what you don't like uh... and
uh... it'd be good

397
00:19:57,859 --> 00:19:58,629
but thank you guys very much




1
00:00:01,510 - > 00:00:06,939
实际上，我是去年没事
在这个阶段，呃......

2
00:00:06,940 - > 00:00:11,130
我给聊一会儿。实际上
我只是要打出快速呃......
该权利的摘录

3
00:00:11,130 - > 00:00:16,298
现在

4
00:00:16,298 - > 00:00:17,390
我谈

5
00:00:17,390 - > 00:00:19,118
Web开发工作流程

6
00:00:19,118 - > 00:00:22,448
因为我觉得在过去两年
特别是年已经有
很多工具，

7
00:00:22,449 - > 00:00:26,609
我们已经有了作为开发商增加
我们的生产效率，减少我们的压力

8
00:00:26,609 - > 00:00:30,219
把它们放在一起的实物
工作流程，使意义上来讲已经
一个有趣的挑战

9
00:00:30,219 - > 00:00:33,460
所以我要通过什么走
我的方法已经和一些
我见过的其他方法

10
00:00:33,460 - > 00:00:34,960
开发商做

11
00:00:34,960 - > 00:00:36,800
呃...第一件事，我要指出的

12
00:00:36,799 - > 00:00:40,659
请尝试不注意
巨大的犀牛genetalia背后

13
00:00:40,659 - > 00:00:44,919
我

14
00:00:44,920 - > 00:00:46,070
它是分心

15
00:00:46,070 - > 00:00:48,289
它是非常分散

16
00:00:48,289 - > 00:00:49,880
嗯...

17
00:00:49,880 - > 00:00:54,480
但无论如何，是去年我跟
有关JavaScript的工作流程

18
00:00:54,479 - > 00:00:55,489
2013

19
00:00:55,490 - > 00:01:00,240
嗯...所以我估计这将是一种
好重新审视，现在，它是

20
00:01:00,240 - > 00:01:04,329
2013年，所以这是JavaScript
现在创作的工作流程

21
00:01:04,329 - > 00:01:07,269
嗯...是啊

22
00:01:07,269 - > 00:01:11,859
去年的几件事情，我感动
呃...只是快一点摘录

23
00:01:11,859 - > 00:01:13,239
在这里和那里的东西

24
00:01:13,239 - > 00:01:15,420
所以我觉得有实时反馈

25
00:01:15,420 - > 00:01:20,340
是一件重要的事情现场重新编译
现在现场重新按摩？

26
00:01:20,340 - > 00:01:21,280
这里

27
00:01:21,280 - > 00:01:22,820
上海社会科学院决赛

28
00:01:22,819 - > 00:01:24,549
接下来是源地图

29
00:01:24,549 - > 00:01:25,890
还好，只是

30
00:01:25,890 - > 00:01:26,849
快速的小

31
00:01:26,849 - > 00:01:31,829
位和羁绊的技术嗯...蜂鸣器
话，但所有有用的东西，最后

32
00:01:31,829 - > 00:01:34,549
今年我种表现出一种把
这些一起种不同

33
00:01:34,549 - > 00:01:36,599
技术，以一种进入

34
00:01:36,599 - > 00:01:40,688
那种一起工作的工作流程
呃...但铬开发工具团队，我们一直

35
00:01:40,688 - > 00:01:44,709
思考这个问题想通了，我们如何能够
使之成为一个更具凝聚力的工作流程

36
00:01:44,709 - > 00:01:48,209
我想告诉你一些
功能呃......

37
00:01:48,209 - > 00:01:52,869
这方面的工作，已走出
首先是称为工作

38
00:01:52,870 - > 00:01:55,719
嗯...但是，恩...

39
00:01:55,719 - > 00:02:00,700
呃...这是令人尴尬的呃...所以
只有忍耐我，我会立即解决这个问题

40
00:02:00,700 - > 00:02:04,189
只是大胆达

41
00:02:04,189 - > 00:02:07,700
只要杀了这个实际上我要去
来我的编辑器

42
00:02:07,700 - > 00:02:08,438
让我们做一些

43
00:02:08,438 - > 00:02:13,338
空间，这样我们就可以把一些
新的风格呃...我不需要这个宽度

44
00:02:13,338 - > 00:02:17,229
这应该可以解决，我可以关闭此框阴影

45
00:02:17,229 - > 00:02:22,488
行高，看起来右侧上下的

46
00:02:22,489 - > 00:02:23,959
和字体大小

47
00:02:23,959 - > 00:02:25,769
呃...

48
00:02:25,769 - > 00:02:30,968
好吧，让我们把这些变化我的编辑

49
00:02:30,968 - > 00:02:32,289
改变盘重装

50
00:02:32,289 - > 00:02:35,728
请一定一定哦

51
00:02:35,729 - > 00:02:37,650
哦，没事

52
00:02:37,650 - > 00:02:44,650
你可以在这里看到

53
00:02:45,419 - > 00:02:49,079
很好的开发工具做这个工作
我让我的样式的变化

54
00:02:49,079 - > 00:02:50,368
面板

55
00:02:50,368 - > 00:02:54,308
它会带来这些回磁盘
让我们说，其实我想添加的东西回到了

56
00:02:54,308 - > 00:02:57,838
这里里面崇高，让我们来看看
我们会做1px的1px的10px的

57
00:02:57,838 - > 00:02:59,258
白

58
00:02:59,258 - > 00:03:03,608
嗯...刚打救过来

59
00:03:03,609 - > 00:03:05,120
在这里，是的，就是这样的

60
00:03:05,120 - > 00:03:09,079
小艾还算不错，但
黑色而不是我要去

61
00:03:09,079 - > 00:03:11,209
没错，这是尖锐的好吗酷

62
00:03:11,209 - > 00:03:15,150
样式看起来不错，但我们仍然有

63
00:03:15,150 - > 00:03:15,989
哎呦

64
00:03:15,989 - > 00:03:17,558
嗯...

65
00:03:17,558 - > 00:03:22,539
所以这是一个HTML幻灯片，但
我使用的是降价的内容

66
00:03:22,539 - > 00:03:23,698
让我们

67
00:03:23,699 - > 00:03:26,049
编辑降价，我会打命令+ O

68
00:03:26,049 - > 00:03:28,859
带来了slides.md的

69
00:03:28,859 - > 00:03:30,729
呃...这里

70
00:03:30,729 - > 00:03:35,409
错字改变，要
小写和打命令+ S保存

71
00:03:35,408 - > 00:03:37,388
和刷新

72
00:03:37,389 - > 00:03:39,789
好看...凉爽的好

73
00:03:39,788 - > 00:03:42,129
所以这是工作区

74
00:03:42,129 - > 00:03:47,938
工作区允许我带
在我的系统上的文件夹到开发工具

75
00:03:47,938 - > 00:03:50,459
编辑什么开发工具是要干什么

76
00:03:50,459 - > 00:03:54,489
什么是未来的线路上的映射
这样我就可以使完整的后端服务

77
00:03:54,489 - > 00:03:55,460
此内容

78
00:03:55,460 - > 00:03:59,180
开发工具的资源映射
当我做出改变的事情

79
00:03:59,180 - > 00:04:02,969
屏幕上，它会是能够使这些
什么是持久性的，以及在磁盘上的变化

80
00:04:02,969 - > 00:04:05,968
我可以编辑一切，这是你知道

81
00:04:05,968 - > 00:04:09,318
这是在这里记下的开发工具团队
本身实际上编辑c + +绑定
内部开发工具开发工具

82
00:04:09,318 - > 00:04:12,149

83
00:04:12,149 - > 00:04:13,140
嗯...

84
00:04:13,139 - > 00:04:16,889
因为他们使他们的风格变化
在“样式”面板中，他们坚持所有这些

85
00:04:16,889 - > 00:04:19,859
永久性磁盘上保存修改
我可以编辑任何地方

86
00:04:19,858 - > 00:04:21,878
完全撤消重做，尤其是在这里

87
00:04:21,879 - > 00:04:24,919
呃...人这是伟大的，因为我能
保持我的背景和跟不上

88
00:04:24,918 - > 00:04:28,990
两回事之间切换
只是这样做在同一个地方

89
00:04:28,990 - > 00:04:30,610
呃...

90
00:04:30,610 - > 00:04:31,740
所有的权利，接下来的事情上涨

91
00:04:31,740 - > 00:04:35,879
这是上海社会科学院的东西，我
提到去年很多人

92
00:04:35,879 - > 00:04:39,339
已经问到这个问题，我想
给您带来了最新与如何工作的

93
00:04:39,339 - > 00:04:41,338
现在里面的开发工具

94
00:04:41,338 - > 00:04:43,009
好吧做到这一点，我会带起来

95
00:04:43,009 - > 00:04:46,490
呃... HTML5的版本，请

96
00:04:46,490 - > 00:04:48,509
这是好看

97
00:04:48,509 - > 00:04:52,649
但我想尝试
这家伙，这里很少使用

98
00:04:52,649 - > 00:04:54,378
徽章

99
00:04:54,379 - > 00:04:59,028
所以，嗯...开放的开发工具，你知道什么
我要去尝试改变它的颜色

100
00:04:59,028 - > 00:05:01,230
所有的权利，使我们在这里

101
00:05:01,230 - > 00:05:03,050
这是很好的

102
00:05:03,050 - > 00:05:07,610
恩...使用了一个背景框阴影
边境右

103
00:05:07,610 - > 00:05:12,528
绿色和一点点越来越暗
果岭下山

104
00:05:12,528 - > 00:05:17,050
因此，如果我们想尝试改变颜色
最近我真的很热衷于靛蓝

105
00:05:17,050 - > 00:05:19,400
呃...我不知道为什么，这很酷

106
00:05:19,399 - > 00:05:24,500
但事实真的不工作这么热

107
00:05:24,500 - > 00:05:25,668
嗯......命令+ Z

108
00:05:25,668 - > 00:05:27,930
好是呵......

109
00:05:27,930 - > 00:05:31,889
所以，如果我点击通过实际的风格CSS

110
00:05:31,889 - > 00:05:36,629
那些你会发现这个Sassy族
貌似编译未压缩

111
00:05:36,629 - > 00:05:38,629
CSS来自样式“面板编译器

112
00:05:38,629 - > 00:05:42,309
还等什么我真正应该做的是创作，在上海社会科学院

113
00:05:42,309 - > 00:05:43,759
让我们打开上

114
00:05:43,759 - > 00:05:50,160
我们去开发工具的设置和造就
萨斯，凉爽的实验和转

115
00:05:50,160 - > 00:05:51,529
刷新页面

116
00:05:51,528 - > 00:05:53,168
带回了开发工具

117
00:05:53,168 - > 00:05:55,418
回到我的选择

118
00:05:55,418 - > 00:05:58,978
现在的第一件事情，你要去
通知是相当小

119
00:05:58,978 - > 00:06:03,240
是，在这里你有悖于
看到青菜文件的位置

120
00:06:03,240 - > 00:06:04,619
这是来自

121
00:06:04,619 - > 00:06:07,240
所以伊马通过点击

122
00:06:07,240 - > 00:06:10,348
所有权利凉爽，所以在这里，我们是在我的青菜文件

123
00:06:10,348 - > 00:06:15,300
呃...使用看起来像使用的实际上是混入

124
00:06:15,300 - > 00:06:20,270
呃...但我想改变颜色
所以我们要去要挖更深一点点

125
00:06:20,269 - > 00:06:22,538
等我回来在这里和我打命令

126
00:06:22,538 - > 00:06:25,899
现在您可以看到，这些东西
有一点可以点击的，所以我要去

127
00:06:25,899 - > 00:06:27,500
命令+点击背景

128
00:06:27,500 - > 00:06:31,988
我们跳进扩展文件
我们的混入定义了

129
00:06:31,988 - > 00:06:34,369
背景框阴影边界权和叶氏

130
00:06:34,370 - > 00:06:36,718
的颜色来

131
00:06:36,718 - > 00:06:40,339
这里实际上是被
它归结变黑

132
00:06:40,339 - > 00:06:41,938
是有道理的所有权利

133
00:06:41,939 - > 00:06:45,210
但我需要再次改变颜色
我回来元素和命令点击

134
00:06:45,209 - > 00:06:47,028
本身的颜色

135
00:06:47,028 - > 00:06:48,158
好的

136
00:06:48,158 - > 00:06:50,319
所以现在我们在我们这里被过度

137
00:06:50,319 - > 00:06:51,759
在我们_vars.scss文件

138
00:06:51,759 - > 00:06:55,559
并且将光标放置在紧接
这个变量被定义

139
00:06:55,559 - > 00:07:00,199
所以使用的是这里
这是绿色和um ...

140
00:07:00,199 - > 00:07:02,319
呃...所以我想尝试它作为

141
00:07:02,319 - > 00:07:06,460
靛蓝，命令+ S

142
00:07:06,459 - > 00:07:13,459
啊......不错

143
00:07:15,769 - > 00:07:20,149
这是相当不错，但说实话，绿色
颜色效果最好

144
00:07:20,149 - > 00:07:24,149
所以只是命令+ Z来还给我的方式，绿色

145
00:07:24,149 - > 00:07:27,968
酷，所有的权利所以这是做无铬
在所有的扩展，因此开发工具，这仅仅是直线上升

146
00:07:27,968 - > 00:07:29,019
其实

147
00:07:29,019 - > 00:07:33,778
唯一的事情，我已经打算在
除了呵...的萨斯支持和

148
00:07:33,778 - > 00:07:34,899
工作区

149
00:07:34,899 - > 00:07:36,348
是我做的有

150
00:07:36,348 - > 00:07:40,738
只是看着一个萨斯手表守护
这些事情，并重新编译

151
00:07:40,738 - > 00:07:42,288
飞

152
00:07:42,288 - > 00:07:46,688
但开发工具是做什么工作
带来的新变化，因为他们在

153
00:07:46,689 - > 00:07:50,129
所以我们有充分的可追溯性，从我的CSS
选择器，属性和

154
00:07:50,129 - > 00:07:53,919
变量恢复到原来的青菜
来源是否来自一个混入或

155
00:07:53,918 - > 00:07:55,478
变量或任何

156
00:07:55,478 - > 00:07:58,808
这实际上是启用
源地图我谈到去年

157
00:07:58,809 - > 00:08:02,879
源地图的javascript，这是相同的
只是CSS技术

158
00:08:02,879 - > 00:08:04,660
呃...这提供的

159
00:08:04,660 - > 00:08:08,420
呃...青菜编译内核
开发工具团队，我应该指出，

160
00:08:08,420 - > 00:08:11,580
嗯...如果你不是青菜用户，并且您
像手写笔或更少

161
00:08:11,579 - > 00:08:17,248
呃...限制完全不可知的，所以
一次小于或手写笔得到支持

162
00:08:17,249 - > 00:08:19,110
创建源地图

163
00:08:19,110 - > 00:08:21,088
它是怎么工作的方式不尽相同

164
00:08:21,088 - > 00:08:23,699
和一个完整的自动重装的样式表

165
00:08:23,699 - > 00:08:25,639
为改变未来

166
00:08:25,639 - > 00:08:26,699
相当不错的

167
00:08:26,699 - > 00:08:31,679
所以结合这些变化真的改变的事情
开发工具可以成为我的编辑

168
00:08:31,678 - > 00:08:35,389
呃...我认为这是真正强大
因为我得到这个作为我的实时反馈

169
00:08:35,389 - > 00:08:37,129
我打字更改

170
00:08:37,129 - > 00:08:40,370
我看到我键入他们的风格变化
是否在CSS或

171
00:08:40,370 - > 00:08:41,310
上海社会科学院

172
00:08:41,309 - > 00:08:43,750
持久化到磁盘

173
00:08:43,750 - > 00:08:46,799
呃...工作区

174
00:08:46,799 - > 00:08:50,339
如果我做的javascript我可以编辑，
它的重新评估在飞

175
00:08:50,340 - > 00:08:54,080
发送到V8和它修补
只是需要照顾它伟大的，当你

176
00:08:54,080 - > 00:08:55,830
做任何形式的校外工作？

177
00:08:55,830 - > 00:08:57,090
呃...

178
00:08:57,090 - > 00:09:01,160
这也很酷，因为当
您编写的代码和你似乎调试？

179
00:09:01,159 - > 00:09:04,568
环境，你可以把破发点
大约在同一个地方，从而导致很大

180
00:09:04,568 - > 00:09:07,579
凝聚力的环境，所有的权利

181
00:09:07,580 - > 00:09:11,980
去年，我还带了一个包
管理，但我捂住实物

182
00:09:11,980 - > 00:09:14,930
我要玩，暗示波浪方式

183
00:09:14,929 - > 00:09:16,089
包管理

184
00:09:16,090 - > 00:09:20,660
的东西，从现在起一年
我们要去有真正强大的软件包

185
00:09:20,659 - > 00:09:24,969
管理工具的基础设施和
很多包在社会权

186
00:09:24,970 - > 00:09:29,509
现在它是一种仍在寻找其
立足之地，但我们将看到一些更

187
00:09:29,509 - > 00:09:32,350
东西很快，我觉得

188
00:09:32,350 - > 00:09:37,350
是啊，嗯......实际上就在几个星期
发布前的凉亭

189
00:09:37,350 - > 00:09:39,778
凉亭的软件包管理项目
年初以来我一直在参与

190
00:09:39,778 - > 00:09:43,619
它真的被撤下奇妙
事情呃......在社区

191
00:09:43,619 - > 00:09:47,168
注册表样的吹起来这是一个
查看的所有组件

192
00:09:47,168 - > 00:09:51,199
凉亭和现在的
很少超过22百

193
00:09:51,200 - > 00:09:53,759
在注册表中的组件

194
00:09:53,759 - > 00:09:57,370
真正伟大的，你作为一个用户和
每当你想拉的东西

195
00:09:57,370 - > 00:09:59,470
它有它的伟大工程的依赖性

196
00:09:59,470 - > 00:10:02,629
也很大，因为它的生态系统
意味着我们能够建立在每个

197
00:10:02,629 - > 00:10:06,240
在一个有凝聚力的方式很多其他的工作

198
00:10:06,240 - > 00:10:08,570
如果你想要得到加快
有一个伟大的介绍一下

199
00:10:08,570 - > 00:10:12,650
凉亭两周前刚刚在谷歌IO
丹hoverd表现出了很多伟大的

200
00:10:12,649 - > 00:10:17,289
的东西，包括一个非常好的工作流程
也使用凉亭和requirejs的自耕农

201
00:10:17,289 - > 00:10:18,230
和咕噜

202
00:10:18,230 - > 00:10:21,570
创造这个伟大的使用经验
包管理的东西，你

203
00:10:21,570 - > 00:10:23,479
可能期望从另一种语言

204
00:10:23,479 - > 00:10:28,350
呃...但它里面
呃...前端的javascript

205
00:10:28,350 - > 00:10:32,220
好吧想回来性能
并在谈论性能

206
00:10:32,220 - > 00:10:33,199
javascript的会议

207
00:10:33,198 - > 00:10:36,149
呃...我可能会谈论的javascript
性能

208
00:10:36,149 - > 00:10:36,700
但它的

209
00:10:36,700 - > 00:10:38,990
好牢记

210
00:10:38,990 - > 00:10:40,470
JavaScript是不是

211
00:10:40,470 - > 00:10:41,519
样的

212
00:10:41,519 - > 00:10:43,480
它并不总是最好的目标

213
00:10:43,480 - > 00:10:47,800
这些幻灯片实际上是从
IE团队回来时，他们释放

214
00:10:47,799 - > 00:10:49,469
IE8

215
00:10:49,470 - > 00:10:53,620
但这个东西是真实的，是因为它是现在

216
00:10:53,620 - > 00:10:56,830
这里，我们接过来一看百强网站，看到哪里

217
00:10:56,830 - > 00:10:58,930
IE浏览器将时间花在

218
00:10:58,929 - > 00:11:00,958
仅有16％的时间花在

219
00:11:00,958 - > 00:11:02,149
在javascript

220
00:11:02,149 - > 00:11:06,169
休息，它在布局呈现格式
这里阿贾克斯重的网站，如

221
00:11:06,169 - > 00:11:10,349
javascript的重像呵... gmail的
谷歌地图

222
00:11:10,350 - > 00:11:13,350
呃...还只是一小部分

223
00:11:13,350 - > 00:11:16,759
这样的javascript往往是一个小
分数的整体性能

224
00:11:16,759 - > 00:11:17,700
图片

225
00:11:17,700 - > 00:11:19,819
所以，如果你想找出如何使

226
00:11:19,818 - > 00:11:22,039
您的应用程序的现场快

227
00:11:22,039 - > 00:11:25,409
我建议你​​看一看在时间轴
里面铬的开发工具，以便

228
00:11:25,409 - > 00:11:28,309
呃...我要表明你现在

229
00:11:28,309 - > 00:11:29,239
好的

230
00:11:29,240 - > 00:11:33,340
所以这是一种信息图形视差网站

231
00:11:33,340 - > 00:11:34,480
它很酷

232
00:11:34,480 - > 00:11:38,149
我只是要通过它滚动
你得到一个机会，看看会发生什么，因为我就这么

233
00:11:38,149 - > 00:11:43,319
向下滚动，我得到这个橙色
圆泡状的家伙，这些

234
00:11:43,320 - > 00:11:44,940
界这里来

235
00:11:44,940 - > 00:11:47,660
一些真棒物理学爆炸

236
00:11:47,659 - > 00:11:48,799
呃...

237
00:11:48,799 - > 00:11:53,229
然后来这里，我们具有视差
影响我继续下去，它很酷

238
00:11:53,230 - > 00:11:55,649
呃......继续下去

239
00:11:55,649 - > 00:11:59,870
这些白色的小圆点形成这些GRIDE的
刚接手的地方

240
00:11:59,870 - > 00:12:02,039
这就是它，所有的权利

241
00:12:02,039 - > 00:12:05,039
让我们回到并打开开发工具

242
00:12:05,039 - > 00:12:07,589
并将其向下拖动至底部

243
00:12:07,590 - > 00:12:09,990
开拓时间表

244
00:12:09,990 - > 00:12:12,100
我要开始录制

245
00:12:12,100 - > 00:12:13,329
刚刚打命令+ D

246
00:12:13,328 - > 00:12:15,139
这是一种快速

247
00:12:15,139 - > 00:12:19,809
然后我只是要去翻阅
同样的东西

248
00:12:19,809 - > 00:12:24,679
嘟嘟嘟嘟

249
00:12:24,679 - > 00:12:28,029
所有的权利，什么是真正酷
我们为您

250
00:12:28,029 - > 00:12:30,129
在本页面种表现

251
00:12:30,129 - > 00:12:31,269
叙述

252
00:12:31,269 - > 00:12:33,549
它开始了在开始的时候是相当的寒意

253
00:12:33,549 - > 00:12:36,649
然后我们转移到这里的部分
那里有很多绿色

254
00:12:36,649 - > 00:12:38,058
现在这是在顶部

255
00:12:38,058 - > 00:12:40,610
我们正在建设这种橙色

256
00:12:40,610 - > 00:12:45,039
爆炸的圆和绿色油漆中使用了的时间

257
00:12:45,039 - > 00:12:48,588
在这里，我们绘制整个
页面上的每一个帧

258
00:12:48,589 - > 00:12:50,430
它采取了良好的时间量

259
00:12:50,429 - > 00:12:53,120
然后进入本节中有很多黄色

260
00:12:53,120 - > 00:12:54,039
这是JavaScript的执行

261
00:12:54,039 - > 00:12:55,730
那就是当我们打

262
00:12:55,730 - > 00:12:58,940
呃...这个小的物理动作这里

263
00:12:58,940 - > 00:13:03,170
这是很安静的部分
在中间，我们打我们的目标

264
00:13:03,169 - > 00:13:06,250
60 fps的帧预算大多帧留底下的

265
00:13:06,250 - > 00:13:07,539
大多

266
00:13:07,539 - > 00:13:10,669
再往下的底部，我们种得
这种不协调的颜色

267
00:13:10,669 - > 00:13:13,919
发生了很多事情，这种
白色的东西爆炸

268
00:13:13,919 - > 00:13:18,860
呃...画javascript和也
一个良好的数额紫色的布局

269
00:13:18,860 - > 00:13:21,120
呃...是怎么回事

270
00:13:21,120 - > 00:13:24,659
但时间表给我们这个整体
发现我们的炸弹吗？

271
00:13:24,659 - > 00:13:27,860
每一部分，这样我们就可以处理有点
我们如何调整这些更精确

272
00:13:27,860 - > 00:13:29,110
性能问题

273
00:13:29,110 - > 00:13:30,810
所以如果我想看看

274
00:13:30,809 - > 00:13:36,319
本节就在这里，我要怎么做
让我们看看这里

275
00:13:36,320 - > 00:13:41,300
呃...我希望得到一个更好的主意
这个JavaScript性能

276
00:13:41,299 - > 00:13:43,490
让我们这样做

277
00:13:43,490 - > 00:13:48,919
我要去型材和收集的CPU配置文件

278
00:13:48,919 - > 00:13:51,789
命中命令+ E

279
00:13:51,789 - > 00:13:53,709
和

280
00:13:53,710 - > 00:13:54,970
它可能是好

281
00:13:54,970 - > 00:13:58,470
现在如果我来这里，呃......

282
00:13:58,470 - > 00:14:00,480
所以这一点，你应使用

283
00:14:00,480 - > 00:14:03,450
一种聚合视图一切是怎么回事

284
00:14:03,450 - > 00:14:08,320
它告诉我这里种有
所有发生的事情信息

285
00:14:08,320 - > 00:14:10,010
以及它没有做什么

286
00:14:10,009 - > 00:14:13,559
把它给我那种这一观点
我可以看到一帧一帧

287
00:14:13,559 - > 00:14:16,959
发生了什么事有点位

288
00:14:16,960 - > 00:14:20,110
所以这是我们发现我们可以
地址，也给你一个更好的主意

289
00:14:20,110 - > 00:14:20,919
据

290
00:14:20,919 - > 00:14:22,748
这个动作的可视化

291
00:14:22,749 - > 00:14:25,279
所以我想告诉你一个新的功能

292
00:14:25,279 - > 00:14:29,019
这就是所谓的火焰图

293
00:14:29,019 - > 00:14:29,990
呃......所有权利

294
00:14:29,990 - > 00:14:32,279
所以在这里，我们有火焰图

295
00:14:32,279 - > 00:14:36​​,759
我们能够找出一种
事物是如何跨越时间的时间尺度

296
00:14:36​​,759 - > 00:14:39,629
在这种情况下，改变它实际上是相当一致的

297
00:14:39,629 - > 00:14:43,189
嗯...看起来就像是一帧一帧
主要执行相同的JavaScript

298
00:14:43,190 - > 00:14:44,820
它会改变颜色，如果不

299
00:14:44,820 - > 00:14:46,290
呃...然后也

300
00:14:46,289 - > 00:14:49,709
所以这是一个特定的帧钻

301
00:14:49,710 - > 00:14:50,790
和

302
00:14:50,789 - > 00:14:53,009
在这种情况下，呃......

303
00:14:53,009 - > 00:14:53,889
宽度是时间

304
00:14:53,889 - > 00:14:57,179
和高度的调用堆栈，所以高度不是太重要

305
00:14:57,179 - > 00:14:58,339
不过呢

306
00:14:58,340 - > 00:15:0​​2,460
如果我想看看我能看到几件事情，让我们说

307
00:15:0​​2,460 - > 00:15:0​​4,030
呃...这里

308
00:15:0​​4,029 - > 00:15:0​​7,429
看起来像D3是一种运行
展示我所有的时间花在内部D3

309
00:15:0​​7,429 - > 00:15:0​​8,419

310
00:15:0​​8,419 - > 00:15:12,779
我们得到了一些插入的孩子，所以它做了一些SVG插入

311
00:15:12,779 - > 00:15:19,240
呃...然后我们有这个四叉树视图
四叉树视图四叉树视图四叉树视图
插入子

312
00:15:19,240 - > 00:15:23,110
也插入属性功能
设置新属性，SVG

313
00:15:23,110 - > 00:15:24,600
在帧结束

314
00:15:24,600 - > 00:15:27,960
这是在这种情况下，一个七毫秒
这是一个相当长的时间

315
00:15:27,960 - > 00:15:29,720
发生的每一个帧

316
00:15:29,720 - > 00:15:33,600
但这种可视化给了我一个伟大的观点了，因为它浸泡了这

317
00:15:33,600 - > 00:15:37,790
首先，我应该怎么解决

318
00:15:37,789 - > 00:15:39,659
所以这是新的火烧图表

319
00:15:39,659 - > 00:15:41,699
你可以检查它在今天铬金丝雀

320
00:15:41,700 - > 00:15:46,090
呃...我们也有一个帆布分析
我想告诉你现在的实验

321
00:15:46,090 - > 00:15:51,850
所以这里只是这个WebGL的水族馆
伊马打开开发工具

322
00:15:51,850 - > 00:15:56,779
并采取帆布配置文件，所以它的
要记录单帆布框架和

323
00:15:56,779 - > 00:16:00,500
它记录所有的呼叫
促成该帧

324
00:16:00,500 - > 00:16:04,129
并捅所有抽奖电话
一个接一个，只是击中的向下箭头

325
00:16:04,129 - > 00:16:06,090
在键盘上穿行

326
00:16:06,090 - > 00:16:09,360
场面实际上是如何绘制的，所以你可以看到

327
00:16:09,360 - > 00:16:11,820
鱼和鲨鱼

328
00:16:11,820 - > 00:16:15,670
进来的球种
和其他一切

329
00:16:15,669 - > 00:16:18,639
然后你打开抽奖电话
并看到所有的函数调用

330
00:16:18,639 - > 00:16:20,259
贡献，平局

331
00:16:20,259 - > 00:16:21,950
回去来源

332
00:16:21,950 - > 00:16:26,210
所以这是很酷，但是这是一个平台，
这是我们能够记录和重放

333
00:16:26,210 - > 00:16:28,120
帆布和WebGL的行动

334
00:16:28,120 - > 00:16:30,568
呃...但真的，我们从这里走

335
00:16:30,568 - > 00:16:34,358
是你的，所以请扳手
那种你将您的反馈意见

336
00:16:34,359 - > 00:16:38,889
喜欢看未来尽可能画布分析器

337
00:16:38,889 - > 00:16:42,649
没事，我会总结了五个关键
开发工具的性能特点

338
00:16:42,649 - > 00:16:44,970
首先连续重绘模式

339
00:16:44,970 - > 00:16:49,009
如果你在时间轴上，你看到了很多
绿色绘画里面度过的时间

340
00:16:49,009 - > 00:16:51,850
那么你可能想在T头
连续重绘模式，它会做什么

341
00:16:51,850 - > 00:16:52,999
是告诉浏览器

342
00:16:52,999 - > 00:16:55,759
哎一遍又一遍画页

343
00:16:55,759 - > 00:16:58,730
这是什么让你做的是关闭的元素和风格

344
00:16:58,730 - > 00:17:01,789
弄清楚什么是贡献
的时间量，它需要画

345
00:17:01,789 - > 00:17:02,769
的页面

346
00:17:02,769 - > 00:17:06,709
呃...这是能够呵...让
你发现了什么贡献你

347
00:17:06,709 - > 00:17:11,230
可以调整呃......它的变化，使
这是一个这是一个有点艰难的

348
00:17:11,230 - > 00:17:12,470
给定的聚合视图

349
00:17:12,470 - > 00:17:15,329
但你能找出到底
有什么贡献

350
00:17:15,329 - > 00:17:19,269
FPS仪表嗯...哪
给你一个很好的观点，你的速度有多快

351
00:17:19,269 - > 00:17:21,029
发送对屏幕的更新

352
00:17:21,029 - > 00:17:24,930
所以除了显示帧每秒
我们也有在该视图中的最小值和最大值

353
00:17:24,930 - > 00:17:26,110
及直方图

354
00:17:26,109 - > 00:17:29,298
也是GPU的内存，所以你可以看到有多少内存

355
00:17:29,298 - > 00:17:33,388
正在使用的当前选项卡，如何
多少是分配的，如果你有很多

356
00:17:33,388 - > 00:17:36,308
你要不断的重意象
驱逐的GPU

357
00:17:36,308 - > 00:17:40,930
这可能是我泡了一个良好的数额GPU性能的内存

358
00:17:40,930 - > 00:17:45,140
呃...下显示涂料矩形的层边界
这些都可以作为设置里面

359
00:17:45,140 - > 00:17:45,969
开发工具

360
00:17:45,969 - > 00:17:49,940
真正伟大的识别涂料
所以你可能会重新粉刷的问题

361
00:17:49,940 - > 00:17:52,750
对每一个滚动整个页面

362
00:17:52,750 - > 00:17:55,779
你不wannna做到这一点，这是
要告诉你一个可视化的视图

363
00:17:55,779 - > 00:17:58,979
在这种情况下发生的真快呵...
它看起来像

364
00:17:58,979 - > 00:18:01,058
这个div刚刚粉刷的，我们有

365
00:18:01,058 - > 00:18:04,569
呃...在这里一层金色边框

366
00:18:04,569 - > 00:18:08,500
它实际上是滚动
铬的复合右

367
00:18:08,500 - > 00:18:11,210
页面顶部的

368
00:18:11,210 - > 00:18:14,890
对象分配纤夫品牌
新的工具，如果你正在做大量的内存

369
00:18:14,890 - > 00:18:18,440
分析这是怎么回事你这么关键
你打一个做记录，它是要花

370
00:18:18,440 - > 00:18:24,490
随着时间的推移不断堆快照
它是如何识别一个特定的部分drillin

371
00:18:24,490 - > 00:18:28,240
看什么样的对象被分配在该节

372
00:18:28,240 - > 00:18:31,250
他们保留大小和他们
护树，这是伟大甚至尝试

373
00:18:31,250 - > 00:18:35,240
确定你的记忆
从到哪里去

374
00:18:35,240 - > 00:18:40,190
最后布局颠簸呃...
这里这个时间表

375
00:18:40,190 - > 00:18:43,470
我们看到了大量的时间花费在
布局

376
00:18:43,470 - > 00:18:47,519
在这里，我们就能够识别出
一堆东​​西，你有一个DOM重

377
00:18:47,519 - > 00:18:49,210
Web应用程序

378
00:18:49,210 - > 00:18:53,170
你可能会看到这样的事情在哪里
你在做布局的布局和布局

379
00:18:53,170 - > 00:18:56,410
你做这一切有没有油漆
工作，你问的浏览器做这一切

380
00:18:56,410 - > 00:18:57,220
工作

381
00:18:57,220 - > 00:19:02,100
用户从来没有见过它的很多
开发工具是要去的，这是一个问题

382
00:19:02,099 - > 00:19:06,000
告诉你，有这个小图标
可能出现的性能瓶颈

383
00:19:06,000 - > 00:19:09,730
呃...这也是我给你
过了很多其他有用的信息

384
00:19:09,730 - > 00:19:13,500
量需要布局的节点
树的大小范围

385
00:19:13,500 - > 00:19:18,150
，也是一个完整的调用堆栈为什么
布局是无效的，为什么它被迫

386
00:19:18,150 - > 00:19:22,030
联合分析功能，并准确地找到
为什么事情引起的，也许你会需要

387
00:19:22,029 - > 00:19:24,119
改变一些东西左右

388
00:19:24,119 - > 00:19:27,639
所以很多的细节，这是获得良好的网络性能的关键

389
00:19:27,640 - > 00:19:29,299
应用程序

390
00:19:29,298 - > 00:19:33,420
好吧，这是一个很多东西铬工具文档
最近有一堆

391
00:19:33,420 - > 00:19:37,070
新的更新，涵盖这些东西
和一堆包括远程

392
00:19:37,069 - > 00:19:41,829
调试一切，我今天呃...
可远程调试

393
00:19:41,829 - > 00:19:46,308
手机呃......所以这是一个真正强大
设置和我鼓励你检查出来

394
00:19:46,308 - > 00:19:50,259
呃...一切，我今天应该也是
他们中的一些背后的金丝雀

395
00:19:50,259 - > 00:19:54,220
实验，但我鼓励你去看看
尝试的事情发牢骚我，告诉我什么

396
00:19:54,220 - > 00:19:57,860
你喜欢什么你不喜欢呵......和
呃...它会是不错

397
00:19:57,859 - > 00:19:58,629
但谢谢你们非常
